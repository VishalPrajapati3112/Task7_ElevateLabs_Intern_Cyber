## 🔍 Steps Performed

1. Opened Chrome extension manager (`chrome://extensions`)
2. Checked each extension's name, purpose, and permissions
3. Verified publisher and user reviews on Chrome Web Store
4. Analyzed risky permissions like:
   - Read/change data on all websites
   - Manage downloads or extensions
   - Access browsing history or DevTools
5. Removed extensions that had high-risk access or unclear functionality
